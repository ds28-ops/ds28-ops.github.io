# Projects

## ML Reproducibility Challenge

- Validated claims made by an ML research paper - "Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision" as part of the coursework at NYU.
- Utilized ML frameworks like Whisper, PyTorch, and TensorFlow to validate the claims made by the paper individually and reported on efficacy.
- Identified drawbacks and suggested further steps and techniques to improve performance.

## Live Human Detecting Robot for Earthquake Rescue Operations

- Led a team of 4 to write code and build a hardware model for the Arduino Uno.
- Created a remotely controlled robot equipped with IR-based human presence detection and a wireless webcam for remote monitoring, resulting in an Indian patent publication with an application number 202241076102.

## Autonomous Driving Car Using Nvidia Jetson Nano

- Led a team of 4 and took charge of building a hardware model with the feature of interfacing the Jetson Nano.
- Developed an autonomous driving car model using the Jetson Nano as its brain, leveraging pre-trained modules using Pytorch and Keras with an efficiency of 92%.
- This resulted in a publication of our paper in ICCMLA 2022 with DOI: [10.1109/ICCCMLA56841.2022.9989127](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCMLA56841.2022.9989127)

## Covid Bot

- Developed a bot that reads travel subreddit posts, warns about Covid cases around the world, and encourages masking and safety practices.
